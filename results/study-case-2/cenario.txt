Create leaf-spine network...
Totally 2 hosts
1 hosts per rack
Totally 3 routers
2 routers on leaf layer
1 routers on spine layer
router 0 uses 2 ports
router 1 uses 2 ports
router 2 uses 2 ports
Available paths from host 0 to host 1
(0, 1),(2, 1),(1, 0)
Available paths from host 1 to host 0
(1, 1),(2, 0),(0, 0)
Assign flows to pairs...
Assign 2 flows from host 0 to host 1
flow 0, 3 packets, buffered at 2 slot
flow 1, 3 packets, buffered at 4 slot
Assign 3 flows from host 1 to host 0
flow 0, 11 packets, buffered at 2 slot
flow 1, 4 packets, buffered at 4 slot
flow 2, 3 packets, buffered at 6 slot
Total 1 path allocations
Exploring the following path allocation...
host 0 to host 1, flow 0, path (0, 1),(2, 1),(1, 0)
host 0 to host 1, flow 1, path (0, 1),(2, 1),(1, 0)
host 1 to host 0, flow 0, path (1, 1),(2, 0),(0, 0)
host 1 to host 0, flow 1, path (1, 1),(2, 0),(0, 0)
host 1 to host 0, flow 2, path (1, 1),(2, 0),(0, 0)
