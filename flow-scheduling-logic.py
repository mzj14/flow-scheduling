Assumption:
1. All links are 10Gps Ethernet
2. All packets are in same size, i.e. 1MTU = 1500 bytes
3. A time slot is 1500 * 8 / 10G = 12us
4. Load balancing will not happen within a flow. Each packet of the same flow takes the same routing path.
5. Each egress port only has 1 queue, whose capacity is infinite.
6. Every end host has to be synchronized with the controller in respect of the time

Input (Remote controller collects this statistics in a period of T):
1. n: number of hosts in the network. Host ids begin from 0.
2. m: number of routers in the network. Router ids begin from 0.
3. dests[s]: list of destination ids related to source s.
4. port_num[r]: number of egress ports on router r.
4. flow_num[s][d]: number of flows from source s to destination d. Flow ids begins from 0.
5. packet_num[s][d][f]: number of packets of flow f from source s to destination d. Packet ids begins from 0.
6. router_choices[s][d][f]: list of list of (router id, egress port id) possibly traversed by flow f from s to d.
7. source_timing[s][d][f][p]: time slot id when packet p in flow f from s to d appeared in the source sending buffer.

Goal: minimize avg flow completion time
# Here, the flow completion time is the duration between the time when the first packet appeared in the source sending buffer
# and the time when the last packet enter the destination receiving buffer

Output:
router_prefer[r][e]: a list of (s, d, f, p) indicating the processing order of each egress port e at router r
sender_prefer[s]: a list of (d, f, p, time_slot_id) indicating the time slot id when packet p in flow f from s to d is sent out to the network.

Intermediate variables:
1. router_path[s][d][f]: list of router ids that actually traversed by flow f from s to d
2. egress_port[s][d][f][r]: the egress port id of flow f from sender s to destination d at router r. Egress port ids start from 0.
3. router_timing[s][d][f][p][r][e]: time slot when the egress port e of router r dequeue packet p in flow f from sender s to destination d.
4. sender_timing[s][d][f][p]: time slot id when packet p in flow f from s to d is send out to the network.
